 Project Tafiti Archive is an open-source project maintained by P.O.U.T. & Slender Studios that not only aims to preserve Microsoft's short-lived, Silverlight-based, interactive search engine but also the rest of the entire collection of open-source Windows Live Quick Apps. 

## What are Windows Live Quick Apps?

Windows Live Quick Applications provide customizable out-of-the box solutions for specific Web scenarios. Each Quick App is built on Windows Live services and is offered as a source code download for you to use today.

*(Description provided from the archived CodePlex page<sup>**1**</sup>)*

> **Note:**<br>
> *Although Microsoft marketed these sample web applications as "a source code download for you to use today", many of the APIs that are utilized in these programs downright no longer exist. That being the case, please be aware that if you choose to fork these they will need either major code rewrites or implementations of modern Microsoft APIs in order to work properly.*

## The applications included in the source code are as follows:<br>
### 1. Retail demo

- The Retail Quick Application shows how you can integrate Windows Live Platform services into a Silverlight E-commerce site.

### 2. Team Builder demo

- Team Builder website allows to where we can see all that's happening with specific group/team. From here any member of site can add photos, upload video and start a conversation with other members online.

### 3. Field Manager demo

- Field Manager allows people who play sports to join a league that may use many different sporting fields. It allows the "player" to keep up to date as to where the field is, if is it open, and any other notes about it.

This application also leverages Silverlight Streaming to provide an interactive video carousel.
