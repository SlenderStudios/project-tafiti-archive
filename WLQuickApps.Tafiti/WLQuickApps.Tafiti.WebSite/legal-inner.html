                                        <span>This is a contract between you and the Microsoft company referenced in section
                                            24. Sometimes Microsoft is referred to as “we,” “us” or “our”. This contract applies
                                            to any Windows Live or MSN software or services, including updates, that you use
                                            while this contract is in force. All of the software or services are referred to

                                            also limits our liability. These terms are in sections 15 and 16 and we ask you

                                            No withdrawal right or other “cooling off” period applies to the service and you
                                            waive any applicable “cooling off” period, except if the law requires a “cooling

                                            We may charge you a different amount than what you approved. If it is a greater
                                            amount, we will tell you the amount and the date of the charge at least 10 days
                                            before we make the charge. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved,
                                            and notify you in advance of the difference. We may bill you for more than one of
                                            your prior billing periods together. If we informed you that the service will be

                                            and the expiration date of your credit card. You can access your billing account

                                            you can make changes to your billing account. You may change your payment method
                                            at any time. If you tell us to stop using your payment method, we may cancel your

                                            the service by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring charges. If you do

                                            late charges when we bill you for them. The late charge will be the lesser of 1%

                                        <span>You can participate in the Microsoft Points service. Microsoft Points is a service
                                            under which you can acquire Points and redeem those Points for certain online services
                                            and digital products. You can see how many Points you have by checking your Points
                                            balance at https://billing.microsoft.com. You can obtain selected services or digital
                                            products that we elect to offer in exchange for Points. You can do this by redeeming
                                            your Points as indicated in the particular messaging you see for those offers.</span></p>

                                        <span>You can acquire Points in a variety of ways. For example, you can purchase Points,

                                            of the service (also known as “promotion Points”). You can earn promotion Points
                                            only for actions you actually complete. You are responsible for any tax consequences
                                            that may result from your participation in the Points service. </span>

                                        <span>When you obtain Points, you have obtained a limited license to a digital product.
                                            Points have no monetary value. You may not obtain any cash or money in exchange
                                            for Points, regardless of how you acquired those Points. Points are not your personal
                                            property. Your only recourse for using Points is to obtain the specific online services
                                            or digital products that we offer for Points redemption. We may further restrict
                                            your Points redemption offers based on your country of residence. We encourage you
                                            to redeem your Points. The existence of a particular offer available for Points
                                            redemption is not a commitment by us to maintain or continue to make the offers
                                            in the future. The scope, variety and type of online services and digital products
                                            that you may obtain by redeeming Points can change at any time. We have no obligation
                                            to continue making offers available for Points redemption. </span>

                                        <span>Promotion Points may expire at any time, as set forth in the messages related
                                            to that promotion. We may cancel, suspend or otherwise limit your access to your

                                            balance. Once we delete Points from a balance, we will not reinstate them, except
                                            at our discretion. When we cancel, suspend or otherwise limit access to your Points
                                            balance, your right to use your Points balance immediately ceases. We will use reasonable
                                            efforts to investigate Points balances that are subject to access limitations and
                                            to reach a final decision on the limitations promptly. In addition, we may limit
                                            your use of the Points service, including applying limits to: the number of Points
                                            you may have credited to your Points balance at one time, the number of Points you
                                            may redeem within a given time period (for example, one day), and the number of
                                            promotion Points you may obtain in a single event.</span></p>

                                        <span>If we post Points to your balance for an activity that is subsequently voided,
                                            canceled or involves a returned item, then we will remove those Points from your
                                            balance. You must ensure that we properly post your Points to your Points balance.
                                            If you believe that you have validly acquired Points that we have not posted to
